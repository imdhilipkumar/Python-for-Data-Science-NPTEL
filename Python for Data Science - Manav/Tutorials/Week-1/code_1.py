# This script introduces basic Python concepts for beginners.

# Defining Variables
# Variables store information that we can use and modify later.
name = "John Doe"  # A string variable
age = 25           # An integer variable
height = 5.9       # A float variable (height in feet)

name = input("What is your name? ")


# Printing Information
# The `print` function displays output on the console.
print("Welcome to the beginner Python script!")
print("Your name is:", name)
print("You are", age, "years old and", height, "feet tall.")
